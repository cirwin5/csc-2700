For Cactuscode:

I am using Github and Gitbash. I was able to clone the src for catctuscode project using 'git svn clone' but could 
not remotely push it using GitBash. I had to find the folder and use GitHub's desktop application and drag the 
repository folder into it then sync it with my account. Once it was in my account I wasnt able to navigate it on my 
account website to find the answers as I did for question 2 and the 'moddle' project.
