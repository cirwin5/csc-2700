For Cactuscode:

1) "Basic structure now implemented. Still needs all the code behind the skeleton."
   svn log : to get log of the revisions

2) commit 1839
   git svn clone http://svn.cactuscode.org/flesh/trunk/src : to clone svn into git
   git log --grep=GROUP_SCALAR : used this to search revision log for specific term.

3) svn co http://svn.cactuscode.org/flesh/trunk/src : to checkout svn
   git count-objects -v : use this to give me a sizepack of 1975 of the 'cloned' svn
   git archive master | tar -x -C ~/new-srcsvn2git/ : I used this command to try and export the repo to a new repo.
                                                      When I went into the directory and used git count-objects -v
                                                      it returned a value of 0. I know the filesize should be less
                                                      because it is suppose to create a clean directory free of meta-
                                                      data but a value of 0 did not seem correct.
   svn --version : to get svn version, using version 1.6.17
